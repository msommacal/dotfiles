# Dotfiles

On Unix systems, shell and application configuration is usually centralized in "dotfiles", files/directories whose names begin with a dot and which are loaded at the beginning of an interactive session or when launching applications. By using a source manager and symbolic links, we can easily historize and synchronize their evolution. 

The purpose of this repository is to allow me to save my configuration. It has only been tested on Ubuntu 19.10. Use with caution of course.
